- 👋 Hi, I’m @cogscicraig
- 👀 I’m interested in social and affective neuroscience... and videogames (seriously can't wait for Elden Ring and BOTW2 to be released)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various neuroimaging modalities and machine learning techniques for analyzing neurophys data
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on making neurosci more accessible to new students (high school, undergrad, general public, etc.)
